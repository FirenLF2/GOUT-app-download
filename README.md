<h2 align="center">Application Promotion Website</h2>
<p align="center">A non-framework built website containing pure CSS and HTML with no Javascript involved. The website was created in a couple days, mainly due to me figuring out how to animate certain elements. <p>
<p align="center">This single page website contains 4 list elements that are links to the information of the application, and are designed in such a way to maintain simplicity.<br> I also added a section 
for the app information/introudcution so that users can check-out what they're about to download. </p> <p align="center">This whole project was fun to make, and i enjoyed the two days that i developed this, 
 had my fair share of fun.</p>
